# Hello

I am Hyunsuh (Daniel) Gu, a Y11 student at Dulwich College Shanghai Pudong

I code (mostly Python) for fun, speedrun celeste (39:44 any%), play osu! ([profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29165713)) and occasionally TMC(Technical Minecraft)

Currently debating on whether I should learn Java so I can make Minecraft mods 

## Ongoing projects
- [D3 tech](https://github.com/n0Oo0Oo0b/d3-tech): a student-led CCA focused on creating an app for other students to use in school
- Advent of Code (236* as of 21/10)
- Beans family bot: a general-purpose discord bot made with discord.py
- Some form of a collection of my PyGame projects
- Learning C++ because apparently Python isn't enough for most college/job applications
