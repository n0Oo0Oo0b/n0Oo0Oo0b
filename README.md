# Hello

I am Hyunsuh (Daniel) Gu, a Y11 student at Dulwich College Shanghai Pudong

I code (mostly Python) for fun, speedrun celeste (37:44 any%), play osu! ([profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29165713)) and Genshin Impact

Currently debating on whether I should learn Java so I can make Minecraft mods
